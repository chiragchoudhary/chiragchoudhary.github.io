I'm a Machine Learning engineer living in San Diego. I work as a senior ML engineer at Qualcomm, providing ML expertise to various internal teams to help them leverage data and build intelligent data-driven solutions. Prior to this, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine, where I completed my thesis on the topic of Knowledge Graph inference under the supervision of <a href="https://sameersingh.org/" style="text-decoration: none">Prof. Sameer Singh</a>. I did my B.Tech in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India. I also have experience working as a software engineer at Oracle.
